Your task: implement the algorithm for modular exponentiation presented in the lecture and benchmark it against a built-in function of the language of your choice. 

    Desired functionality: the number x = b^n mod m is computed
    Metrics: computation time and correctness of result (use WolframAlpha if in doubt)
    Benchmark-tasks 
        5^99 mod 11
        50^529 mod 13
        50^999 mod 17
        a task of your choice
